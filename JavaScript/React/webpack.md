# Webpack

We want to write modular code. But browsers cannot run modularised code, so we need a module bundler. UIs aren't just JavaScript though. Our UI components can also depend on images, fonts, and CSS. Webpack recognises that and with the help of loaders, supercharges the `require` function so you can explicitly require all of your dependencies.

Webpack uses "loaders" to preprocess files while browserify uses "transforms".

```
npm init -y

npm i webpack --save-dev

npm i file-loader --save-dev
npm i url-loader --save-dev

npm i css-loader --save-dev
npm i style-loader --save-dev
npm i postcss-loader --save-dev
npm i postcss-cssnext --save-dev

npm i babel-core --save-dev
npm i babel-loader --save-dev

npm i eslint --save-dev
npm i eslint-loader --save-dev
npm i babel-eslint --save-dev

npm i babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev

npm i babel-plugin-syntax-class-properties --save-dev
npm i babel-plugin-syntax-decorators --save-dev
npm i babel-plugin-syntax-object-rest-spread --save-dev

npm i babel-plugin-transform-class-properties --save-dev
npm i babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy --save-dev
npm i babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread --save-dev

npm i babel-plugin-react-transform --save-dev
npm i react-transform-hmr --save-dev

npm i babel-preset-react-hmre --save-dev

npm i react react-dom --save
```

```

## Loaders

The loaders will only kick into action when you try to `require` something that match the `test` patterns.

Loaders and plugins are commonly confused with each other, but they are completely different things.

Roughly speaking, loaders deal with each source file, one at a time, as they are "loaded" by webpack during the build process. Plugins in the other hand do not operate on individual source files: they influence the build process as a whole.

## Plugins

## webpack.config.js

* [Example](https://github.com/glebm/gulp-webpack-react-bootstrap-sass-template/blob/master/webpack.config.litcoffee)
* [Example](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader/issues/23)

```js
// Here when you compile the code it will be temporarily saved into build/js folder.
// Webpack Dev Server will in turn make that folder's scripts available at the URL /public/assets/js

module.exports = {
  context: path.resolve('js').
  entry: [],
  output: {
    path: path.resolve('build/js/),
    publicPath: '/public/assets/js',
    filename: 'bundle.js'  },
  
  devServer: {
    contentBase: 'public'  }};
```

Single entry or multiple entries for code splitting.

Webpack is mainly a JavaScript-bundler. Its "native" language is JavaScript and every other source requires a loader which transforms it to JavaScript.

## CSS in Webpack

* [React: CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)
* [JSS](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss)
* [See issues#31 for Sass import statement](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader/issues/31)
* [Please don't use CSS in JS](https://medium.com/@ajsharp/please-please-don-t-use-css-in-js-ffeae26f20f#.n1e0tog7i)
* [Khan Academy's aphrodite](https://github.com/khan/aphrodite)

You divide your modules by folders and include both CSS and JavaScript files in those folders. See `entry`.

In Webpack, each Sass file is complied in isolation. It means you need to `@import` dependencies like variables and mixins wherever you use them!?

```
// header.scss
@import 'config/colors'

.header { color: $red; }
```

```
// Loaders will be applied from right to left, piping?
// Use ! to chain loaders
style!css!sass?includePaths[]=
```

* style-loader - take a string, create a `<style>` and handed to DOM
* css-loader - returns JavaScript string, resolve `@import` and `url`
* sass-loader
* file-loader - for css-loader to include images assets

`style-loader` injects `<style>` tag at runtime so it should not work server-side. You can load CSS as just text and then inject it manually.

If `include` isn't set, Webpack will traverse all files within the base directory. This can hurt performance! It is a good idea to set up `include` always. There's also `exclude` option that may come in handy. Prefer `include`, however.

## webpack-dev-server

Deprecated? Replaced by webpack-hot-middleware? webpack-hot-middleware allows you to add hot reloading into an existing server without webpack-dev-server.

A Node.js express server using `webpack-dev-middleware` to serve webpack bundle.

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

* [**Live editing**](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-III)
* [What exactly is HMR?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24581873/what-exactly-is-hot-module-replacement-in-webpack)
* [React hot loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/2014/07/23/integrating-jsx-live-reload-into-your-react-workflow/)
* [Don't trigger module reloading when there were errors generating the bundle](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/42)
* [**You need to do module.hot at main entry file**](https://github.com/christianalfoni/react-webpack-cookbook/wiki/Hot-loading-components)
* [Troubleshooting guide for react-hot-loader issues](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)
* [**react-transform-hmr** -- or just use babel-preset-react-hmr](https://github.com/rackt/redux/pull/690/files)
* [React Transform not more?](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/hot-reloading-in-react-1140438583bf#.twy02sj70)

Without hot loading, the browser essentially refreshes with a flash and loses all states.

If you have this problem:

`GET http://localhost:3000/__webpack_hmr net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING`

It means you cannot use `nodemon` to restart server and have HMR working.

If you get this error:

`Uncaught (in promise) Error: Aborted because 167 is not accepted(…)`

It means you are editing the root component.

## Feature Flags



## Production

* [Tree-shaking with Webpack 2 and Babel 6](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html)

Run uglify dead-code elimination.

```
webpack -p -d // source-map in production (minified also)
```

Especially with lodash or moment.js:

```js
// Don't do this
import { concat, sortBy, map, sample } from 'lodash';

// Instead, require individually
import concat from 'lodash/concat';
import sortBy from 'lodash/sortBy';
import map from 'lodash/map';
import sample from 'lodash/sample';
```

## HTML Hash Injection

* [Long term caching for vendor files](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/long-term-caching-of-static-assets-with-webpack-1ecb139adb95#.78z201x62)

Use `assets-webpack-plugin` to access the JSON stats object.

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

* [Welcome to Future of Web App Delivery](https://medium.com/@ryanflorence/welcome-to-future-of-web-application-delivery-9750b7564d9f#.92jy4id68)
* [Official example of code splitting and multiple entry points](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multiple-entry-points)

Webpack allows you to split bundles in various ways. You can even load them dynamically as your application gets executed. This sort of lazy loading comes in handy for large applications. You can load dependencies as you need them.

```js
const login = require('./login'); // will be bundled

login(() => {
  // hints to webpack to split this code out of the bundle
  // but "ensure" that it is available before the callback runs

  require.ensure([], () => {
    // webpack will load this dynamically when needed
    var willNotBeBundled = require('./DashboardPage');
  });
});
```

Use JSON manifest file for production fingerprinting.

1. Forget about Rails Asset Pipeline.
2. Have a folder called "front-end", "fe" or "webpack"
3. Use [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to start Rails server + webpack watcher
4. Ask webpack to build assets for us and put it directly in `/public` folder.
5. Generate JSON file with the hashes fingerprinting for Rails view to use. See [assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/sporto/assets-webpack-plugin)
6. Do not commit the generated bundle from webpack! gitignore it also.
