In React Router, unlike Ember, nested route do not correspond to nested URL. It gives you complete freedom of what your URL look like. Just because you nest a route doesn't mean you need to append a segment to the URL to match.

Routing is just data: `location.hash.substr(1)`

## Overview

> Nested route is nested UI. You should only nest your routes if your UI is nested. - [From Ember](http://fromrailstoember.com/9-nested-routes-equals-nested-ui/)

1. You declare your view hierarchy with nested `<Route />`
2. React Router will match the deepest route against the URL and activate the entire tree of routes on that branch, nesting all the UI.
3. You simply use the `this.props.children` and it will render the active child route.

```js
const routes = (
  <Route path="/" component={App}>
    <IndexRoute component={Dashboard} />
    <Route path="/inbox" component={Inbox} />
    <Route path="calendar" component={Calendar} />
  </Route>
)

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router history={browserHistory}>{routes}</Router>,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

Whenever a hash change, a callback will be called. This callback is being registered and setup at `Router.run()`. It just pass in a `Handler` to be inserted into the view's `<RouteHandler />`.

It is just like the `{{outlet}}` in Ember. You can have multiple `this.props.children` or even named components?

Think of Router as describing your interface rather than a URL structure. Routes are completely independent from the URL of API resources. Even if your API URLs are nested, it does not necessarily mean that your React routes should be.

`<Router>` and `<Route>` are 2 different things, even though they are technically React components, but they don't actually create DOM themselves.

It may help to think of a `<Route>` as an "entry point" into your UI. You don't need a route for every component in your component hierarchy, only for those places where your UI differs based on the URL.

If a route uses a relative path, it builds upon the accumulated path of its ancestors. Nested routes may opt-out of this behavior by using an absolute path.

## Dynamic Segments

Explicit static paths match more closely than dynamic paths.

## Transition

```
transition.redirect('/login');
transition.retry();
transition.abort();
```

## Link

Normal HTML link will cause a refresh. Use <Link> instead.

```js
<Link to="/home" activeClassName="active" onlyActiveOnIndex>Home</Link>

<IndexLink activeStyle={{color: blue}}>Home</IndexLink>

<Link to={{
  pathname: '/jobs',
  query: { page: '12' }
}}>Page 1</Link>
```

```js
this.props.params
this.props.location.query

// e.g.
this.props.params.address
this.props.location.query.page
```

## Code Splitting and Partial Application Loading

* [Welcome to Future of Web App Delivery](https://medium.com/@ryanflorence/welcome-to-future-of-web-application-delivery-9750b7564d9f#.92jy4id68)
* [example-react-router-server-rendering-lazy-routes](https://github.com/rackt/example-react-router-server-rendering-lazy-routes)

You no need to define your entire route config up front anymore as 1.0 brings first-class support for code-splitting on routes so that adding routes deep in your app doesn't increase the size of the initial bundle.
