## Composite Pattern (Delegation)

Why we don't use composition so often. The reason is Ruby mixins are more popular. Look at DHH's `concerns`.

The result of mixins is you end up with a class which has lots of responsibilities. It leads to object/self schizophrenia which is a complication arising from delegation (having a split identity).

Use mixins for Roles in the DCI sense.

> In an e-commerce app you would have User class but the buying/cart logic would be in the Buyer module. The User class knows nothing about cart, buying.

## Filters

Do not have dependencies between filters.

## Action

One controller action is a specific Use Case. It is the Context in DCI. A single HTTP request is some kind of a Use Case!

Just like Flux's *action* is a single Use Case.

## DCI and the use of `extend`

* [DCI and MVC](http://rebo.ruhoh.com/dci-and-mvc/)
* [Why DCI Contexts?](http://rebo.ruhoh.com/why-dci-contexts/)

Already defined method calls will always be faster than `extend` method calls.
