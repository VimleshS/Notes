# OOD

* Changing requirements introduce forces that apply sudden and unexpected pressures that work against the best-laid plans. It is the need for change that makes design matter.
* Object needs to know other objects in order to communicate and send messages. This is natural. But this also create dependencies. OOD ultimately is about managing dependencies.
* In the absence of design, unmanaged dependencies wreak havoc because objects know too much about one another. This is a very common pitfall and is the first principle in SOLID design, the SRP.
* Design is a journey along a branching path wherein earlier choices close off some options and open access to others.
* OOD metrics cannot identify designs that do the wrong thing in the right way.
* Arranging code to efficiently accommodate change is a matter of design.
* Refactor towards patterns instead of implementing a pattern right away.
* Good design preserves maximum flexibility at minimum cost by putting off decisions at every opportunity, deferring commitments until more specific requirements arrive. When that day comes, refactoring is how you morph the current code structure into one that will accommodate the new requirements.

> Knowing how software should look when it's done does not cause it to build itself; applications come into existence because some programmer applied the tools. The end result, be it a beautiful cabinet or a rickety chair, reflects its programmer's experience with the tools of design.

OO applications are made up of *parts* that interact to produce the behavior of the whole.

In functional programming, the *parts* are functions itself.

Both paradigms need to be used "together" in terms of front-end UI code and backend business logics. Only only one paradigm is suicidal.

OOP is definitely good for business logics and processes. It is good for Domain-Driven development.

Roles, not inheritance!

TDD testers hate BIG objects!
