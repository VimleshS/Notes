# Deep Learning

* Deep belief network

Learning rate. Parallelism? CPU? I/O?

How to train large NN (Neural Network)? For lots of matrix operations, you will want to use TESLA GPU. Or you can use Distributed Training (on the cloud).

Training the classifiers. What is classifiers?

Transfer learning.

You ask question from your trained models.

Policy - state of the world and act on something.

## Frameworks
