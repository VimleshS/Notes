## Promise Theory

* [The Promises of DevOps](http://markburgess.org/blog_devops.html)

SOA is an example of a promise-oriented model, that is based on Web Services and APIs, because it defines autonomous services (resources) with interfaces (APIs) each of which keeps well-documented promises.

PT models human intentions.

This is my intention and I promise to keep it.

### CAMS

* **Culture** (of communication and discipline)
* **Automation** (superhuman scale and speed)
* **Measurement** (bringing verification and certainty)
* **Sharing** (to enable a rapidly growing community to raise the bar quickly)


## Component-based Architecture

Conway's Law - Organized around business capabilities

Build product, not projects (see Amazon case study)

Design your microservices around "business capabilities"

Transaction vs Eventual consistency.

Each service has it's own database. StarBuck don't do 2-phase commit.
