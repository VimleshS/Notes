# Tools

Design is a process best served by consistent, frequent feedback. It's about messy iterations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and problem-solving.

Design decisions don't live independently of business or engineering goals - their impact is deeply intertwined with how well a business performs.

> Being a jack-of-all-tools feels deceptively productive, preparing to work is not the same thing as actually working.

> It's not about the code. It's not even about the tools. Prototyping is about asking reality for feedback. [Put the "designers should code" debate to rest](http://www.the-haystack.com/2015/09/02/put-the-designers-should-code-debate-to-rest/)

## Prototyping

> Interactive prototypes allowed me to express micro-interactions and workflows in a way that made sense to stakeholders, which improved my ability to communicate design tremendously.

Prototyping benefits:

1. Design solutions are truly holistic - designers are required to think through edge cases or microinteractions that don't necessarily present themselves when developing statics.
2. Communication is clearer
3. Clarity is achieved faster - A prototype is worth a thousand meetings.
4. Help designers become better storyteller and better communicators.

Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.

**Prototype is the cheapest and easiest way to get an idea out of your head and into a testable form**

* To understand
* To test and improve
* To communicate

Prototyping has become an integral part of product design.
