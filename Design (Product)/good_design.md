# Good Design

[**Design MUST deliver RESULT**](https://mokriya.quora.com/Designer-Duds-Losing-Our-Seat-at-the-Table)

> A "great" design which produces bad outcomes - low engagement, little utility, few downloads, indifference on the part of the target market - should be regarded as a failure.

Design is the ability to envision and communicate a range of options; selecting the best one for specific requirements and constraints.

Visual polish is not important. Design must be enduring, like Wikipedia, Craigslist.

Automation looks good on the surface. But how practical is it. Smart washing machine? Smart fridge that anticipate your needs? Isn't your need changes every seconds? What is your relationships with these automated system?

Humble systems. Not smart system. Relationship design is the new UX.

> You see, even when you have a pack of designers roaming your halls, it's hard for analytical cultures to integrate creative ones. The reason being that analytical cultures traditionally start with an answer, and then break the problem down into its constituent parts, whereas creative cultures start with questions and look at problems holistically. We're not delivering a verdict here that one approach is superior to another, just that one invariably ends up being dominant. From the very beginning, IDEO has been a culture that starts with questions. It's the only way we know how to uncover pressing human needs and design toward them. That's at our core.

> In the weeks that followed, I looked to my Fitbit to help manage my recovery. Everything about the Fitbit is engineered to encourage you to move more, but I wanted to move less - more slowly, more carefully. My goals no longer matched up with the activity tacker design defaults.

---

> We've done an excellent job of developing products, but a terrible job of designing products. - Design for Dasein

---

> When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can often times arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions - Steve Jobs

---
> Beauty is subjective, but design isn't about beauty, it's about function, and you can measure how well something succeeds at its functionality.
>
> People tend to conflate well designed things with beautiful things because when something is well designed its purpose and functionality are clear and it has nothing extraneous that detracts from its core essence, and people tend to find that appealing.
>
> That said, a mouse that can't be charged while in use is definitely not a sign of good design.

---
> Good Design is as little design as possible. Less but Better.

> The poet always has too many words in his vocabulary, a painter too many colours in his palette, a musician too many notes on his keyboard - Jean Cocteau (Less is More)

1. **Good design is simple.** When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
2. **Good design is timeless.** If something is ugly, it can't be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it. If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
3. **Good design solves the right problem.**
4. **Good design is suggestive.** It does not impose, but suggest.
5. **Good design is often slightly funny.** Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called humourless also being good design.
6. **Good design looks easy.** Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.
7. **Good design uses symmetry.**
8. **Good design resembles nature.**
9. **Good design is redesign.** It's rare to get things right the first time. You should cultivate dissatisfaction.
10. **Good design can copy.** If part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, there's no reason not to use it.
11. **Good design happens in chunks.**
12. **Good design is often daring.** Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.
13. [Don't give your users shit work - Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/)
14. Let's talk about making tools. The things we make should either reduce pain, increase pleasure, or do some mix of the two - [No New Tools](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/)
15. Good design is motivated by use cases, workflows.
16. Good design is built from small, orthogonal, and com posable primitives.
17. [Designing is editing](http://blog.simplease.at/2014/05/designing-is-editing/)
18. **Good design is about taking things apart.** Module, components, etc.
19. Simplicity is actual work.
20. Understanding, not simplicity
21. Complex, but understandable
22. Complicated == Confusing
23. Complex == Life!
24. If it is too simple, it is dull, boring. If it is too complex, it is confusing. We like intermediate which is a moving target! Expert mode, see game designer.
25. Design is Social Science, Art, Technology and Engineering.
26. The idea of a design driven company is that design is for the entire company, not just designers but for engineers also. Cautioned the overuse of the term "design driven" so as not to exclude other key players necessary to build a user-centered product and successful company.
27. Making something helps remove the rust.
28. Design is rendering intention. Design is about intention. We can choose to imitate or innovate.
29. Experiences can be designed. It is within our control.
30. Making something look simple is easy; making something simple to use is much harder.
31. One cannot not communicate. Therefore there is no such thing as a neutral design. Everything has a voice.
32. [Empathy in Design - See the world in perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrogFRt8fE)
33. Good design well crafted.
34. Good design is vision of the end experience. Clear, high design expectations across organization. Shared understanding of what needs to be done. Priority and commitment.
35. Technologies enabled, design established.
36. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.
37. Don't try to own the experience. Let the community own it!
38. A lot about design is telling a good story.

1. Some designers will come up with an idea, and maybe at first it will seem a little strange. If there was some top-down review process, it wouldn't survive. But then it will turn out that it's a huge win with users.

> "In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service." - Steve Jobs

> My advice is to make things that are truly great. Don't make things that are great at earning money, winning users, pleasing investors, or satisfying your ego. Make things that are great at doing the task they are intended to do.

> This is where creating products becomes art. If you are making the product good just for the sake of it being good, then it's art. The great thing is, it usually ends up satisfying the other business-related goals even better than if you had optimized for them specifically. I consider this mentality a life decision, not a business decision.

> The more you fail, the more you succeed. The longer you wait to fail, the fewer successes you'll have. My biggest failure is not failing fast enough when I knew time was already up. My advice to anyone trying anything, fail, then try again.
