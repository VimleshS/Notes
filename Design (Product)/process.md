> "A sculptor may sit down to sculpt something without a clear idea of the exact form it will take."

> Cheap iteration help shipping. So make iteration cheap to do!

Concept Driven Design

> We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.

---

> Design it, test it, iterate

---

> There's no real context to the solutions we find as we only tend to see things in silo, How does the element sit with the rest of the experience they created?

Rapid cycle time.

Product to be in touch with customer.

Things that help you to remember when you start to design:

1. User Story Map
2. User Onboard (useronboard.com)
3. Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)
4. Prototyping - Prototyping as fast, as dirty, as rapidly as possible (Ideo)
5. Design sprint
6. Iterative
7. Prioritize
8. Set boundaries (Bounded Context?)
9. Bring structure to where it was lacking
10. Design system, not pages (Pattern libraries, Atomic Design)
11. Don't sell technology, sell solution
12. Know your Value Proposition. Make it compelling. Build trust.

> Imagine. Implement. Iterate. Improve.

> "It was a couple of very simple insights, when you get down to it, that drove how the thing would behave," Yurchenco says. "And that determined how you’d design it."

---
> "If our design is allowing them to do something wrong, it’s not their fault. It’s our fault"

---
> "When I was first learning about injection molding, I'd go hang around a tooling shop and ask questions," he says. “And they'd have some language to describe what they were doing, and they'd tell me how they were doing it. And I'd go into another shop, and there'd be a little twist on it. They'd have a different language and a different way of doing it. And I'd go into a third shop, and it was the same thing. They're all ending up with the same result in the end, which is an injection mold. But they’re getting there in different ways. And by constantly asking the same questions over and over again, I learned a heck of a lot about injection molding, to the point where I know a lot more than most of these toolers do. Cause I've been to 300 shops and seen 300 ways of doing it. And the more you know how to make things, the better designer you're going to be."

---
> No decision might seem better than a bad one, but at least with a bad decision we’ve learned something.

> If you’re a leader of a team, empower your designers (and your entire team, really) to make these hard decisions and to own the consequences. As much as indecision can damage a project or team, so can constantly asking for permission.

> The obvious problem here is the lack of any design in the first place. Going from the idea directly to implementation with minimum effort on design usually proves to be a very bad idea.

> Util actual users use it, everybody is working with assumptions (some might just have more accurate assumptions than others).

> An MVP should be fast and easy to put through a reality check. If you have the team capable of delivering this in 3 days, why do more?

> If you think that it's impossible to test your idea in 3 days, you are wrong. Because what you need is not a fully functional prototype, but simply a proof that your idea will drive some interest, which is something that can be achieved with a fraction of what you think your product should do.

Something to break the ICE:

* The McDonald's suggestion. "How about McDonalds?" to break the ice and kick off ideas flowing in.
* If you have a magic wand, what will you do? Pretend you have infinite resources and time, how would we do this?
* Stay in sketch mode, much longer than you think. Longer than you're probably used to. As soon as you go into Photoshop you're slowing yourself down and walling yourself off. In the beginning of the process, when **alignment** and problem solving are paramount, you need to stay in sketch mode as long as possible.
* Tons of artboards and layers, but no clear story or point of view. No pitch.

Users of your app are there to get things done. They build behavior patterns and workflows around the features they really need, and in doing so, start to forget about the others. As they sink into your app, they become feature blind.

> Learn early and often rather than launch early and often - [What fuels great design](http://www.gv.com/lib/what-fuels-great-design-and-why-most-startups-dont-do-it)

FACTS : ASSUMPTION : QUESTIONS

- We assume people will be interested in this, that, etc...
- We assume it is free

Identify the problem first before you try to solve them.

## Lean UX

Agile is great with its lightweight iterative approach. The problem with the sprints is that it never allows for looking **holistically** at the entire picture.

> For more iterative work, agile is pretty great. For designs/problems that require more holistic thinking, it often wastes more time than it's trying to save. Better to give yourself a little space to solve those complex problems outside the agile cadence, then fold it back in to sprints once you've got it better figured out.

---

> You're not iterating if you only do it once - David Bland

---

> As designers of any stripe, we get very easily sucked into designing and building to a high level of fidelity, rather than creating low-fidelity/low-quality versions of the fuller system. Agencies in particular are conditioned to think of deliverables as needing to be high-quality and high-fidelity. There's a discomfort at the idea of delivering something low-fidelity or sketchy that we - and our clients, of course - need to get over.

* [How we quickly test our ideas before building](http://tales.timehop.com/post/91976772996/how-we-quickly-test-our-ideas-before-building-and-the)

MVP - The smallest amount of work necessary to start learning!

Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons.

* Cross-functional
* Design and development in parallel. Informs each other.
* From doubt to certainty. Risk you are taking is tiny. The paper prototype is cheap. If it doesn't work out, throw away it quick.
* Generating many options and decide quickly what to pursue.
* Recognize hypotheses and validate them.
* Goal driven
* Outcome focused
* Think/Make/Check
* State your desired outcomes - What success looked like?
* Declare your assumptions and then hypothesize: Write the test first (TDD in product)
* Get out of the building
* De-risking gradually by moving from doubt to certainty (concrete)
* Business is an assumption. If market does not validate, your guess (no matter how smart and beautiful) will be wrong.
* Discovery approach
* Learning as the unit of progress

What assumptions do you have about your customers that if proven false, will cause you to fail? In other words: what do you need to know in order to move forward successfully?

Every design decision is a hypothesis. Declare your assumptions and test them. Evaluate your results ruthlessly, and be prepared to change course.

* Prioritize learning over growth
* Prioritize making over analysis
* Reality testing

> We believe that [doing this] for [these people] will achieve [this outcome]
> We'll know this is true when we see [this market feedback]

Change in behavior = Our KPI

**Features** achieve our **outcome** (change in behavior).

## Mech's Process

Product managers are constantly balancing the demands of speed and quality.

If you can identify with that kernel of success - which is a user or customer succeeding with your product and feeling really good about it - and then figure out how to design a product that ensures that success among many users, that's when you've really nailed it.

* Collect phase (Diverge) - Don't evaluate, just collect. Don't edit. Use "echo technique" to talk back and reaffirm with stakeholder. Moderate, don't edit. Take pictures. Share result.
* Converge (Coalesce) - Narrow down and evaluate.
* Workshop - you present by testing. Show stakeholders what you've learned. Get them to "echo" back to you. Invite them to amend.
* Don't try to define *objects*. Think in association and relation instead. Actions are cheap, vocabulary is expensive.
* Iterate until DONE. Not 100%. Close enough is close enough. Don't get caught in an endless loop.

1. Know your (lightweight) personas. Who we believed we're building our product for. Perceived target audience. Personas drive **outcome**.
2. Measure and iterate
3. Scale out (more machines) is better
4. Share as soon as possible
5. Always announce your deadline. Create time pressure.
6. Insights from the whole team
7. No group brainstorming. Own individual sketch, then compete and pick/vote.
8. Not need to "Ship early, ship often". But "Learn early, learn often". Rent before you buy.
9. Design matters. Speed matters.
10. Win or learn. There is no loser in a design sprint.
11. Solving the right problem first.
12. Make great things. Fast.
13. Customer journey for XXX
14. Paper prototype (you always forget this!)
15. Small chunk of risk. An app that do 1 thing. Then learn and grow.
16. Time-box. You know you're done when you run out of time.
