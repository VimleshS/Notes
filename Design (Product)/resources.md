It's not about the product, it's about your users.

It's much easier to add features and create an illusion that the software is powerful than to actually invest effort, understand the needs of real users, and develop the product accordingly.

Stories are broken into Epics. Epics has their main flow. Design the task flow with boxes and arrow? Then visualize the flow with prototypes/wireframes. Low-fidelity wireframes, then high-fidelity interactive prototype.

## Lean and MVP

* [MVP vs MDP](http://www.startupblender.com/minimum-viable-product-vs-minimum-delightful-product/)

Laser printer - Xerox trying to do too much and missed the boat. IBM beat them?

Intermingle with business and marketplace.

90% of startups failed.

Don't ask "Can you build it"! Ask "should you build it"!

Validate these:

* Problem - Is there a problem your app is solving? Is anyone care about that problem even? If so, validate it!
* Market - Are there enough people who have this problem and care about this problem?
* Product - Is our product solving this problem for this market?

Pager Study. Ask repeated questions. Don't use yes/no, opinion, or number questions. You won't learn much. Ask behavioral questions.

## Behavioural

> Understanding the psychology and science behind how people interpret information, make decisions, and take action enables us to deliver more effective designs.

Predict behaviour - not a literal sense. But with enough data to predict. Predictive system? Adaptive UI?

> Because people's behavior hadn't changed, our differentiators didn't actually matter - [Bret Taylor](http://firstround.com/review/take-on-your-competition-with-these-lessons-from-google-maps/?ct=t)
>
> One of my biggest lessons from watching the early internal users of Google Maps was that we needed to present people with an unfamiliar experience to get them to change their behaviors.
>
> The bottom-line is you have to build a lens to allow users to see a new world rather than features to help them see an old world better.

---

> As technology gets more accessibility, especially in developing economies, have you ever wondered what is the real struggle in creating meaningful experiences for those the users in low income countries with no education? It is not only a struggle in creating simple and amazing experiences, rather in creating trustworthy ties with the user. My focus has been on financial credits, mortgages, and insurances. I got a tumbling start thinking 'how can they trust your financial webpage, when they have even trouble in trusting their banks online'. In latin american countries, where there is so much insecurity in the country overall (crime rates, economic strife, etc.), they trust family and friends rather than experts. In order to create a solution, I had to turn to emotional design. Through transparency, empathy, friendliness, and a simple learning process for the users you can create the trust needed for the users to use the financial products. Join me through my rocky journey of creating a meaningful product in MÃ©xico.
