HR silo - HR-optimized organization represent friction. Barriers. The danger of silos within organization. Tragedy of the commons.

**In HR, how can we let client be the source of supply and also demand - See https://medium.com/backchannel/here-are-the-secrets-of-unicorn-companies-c8951b99215b**

**Hiring Pipeline** - First, Pipeline Construction. Map out your Stages. Prescribed, but you can add your own stages. Pipeline stages are "feedback opportunity" between recruiter, candidate, and clients. Each stage can have rules, checklist, milestone, checker, linter, etc. Confidence level will be high as the stages progresses to Hired. Increasing confidence as the stage progresses. Beware of ineffective notification on pipeline. Alert fatigue.

## Problem

In light of ever razor-thin profit margins, how can we perform thing faster to get ahead of out competitors?

## Content Model

Tags are too freeform and unreliable. They are too independent and does not work well as a system. Instead, lets use taxonomies and categories to construct our content structure. It will be more reliable for building automatic system.

Categories must not be 3 level deep. The Inception Rule.
