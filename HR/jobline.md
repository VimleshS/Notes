# Jobline's Problem

Emergent behaviors? Abstraction can emerge useful behaviors? Builder build things to be used in different way. Lego blocks. Modular pieces of functions.

> As a consequence, Taylor says, the customers who really "get" Quip have documents that are completely different than the documents they had in the last generation of products: rather than memos and contracts, they're creating team checklists for project management, spreadsheets to track recruiting candidates and editorial calendars, and year-long documents full of weekly meeting notes.

Checklist for approving?

Make customer WANT and VALUE your product. Bring CLARITY to everything. No out-of-context. Communicate and give context and clarity to the tasks/services you offer.

Transform human capabilities.

Opportunity for impact in HR industry. In the HR, people have jobs to get done.

Faster? But wrong outcome?

Critical success, but business failure.

[Data, not source code. Company workers will change their activities to align with the company data feed.](http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/15/the-golden-age-of-open-source-has-arrived/)

> Amazon owns the service that lets users instantly view, investigate and select products. Uber owns the service that connects people immediately needing a ride to cars that will take them to their destination. What service does your business own, and who and what does it connect? Therein lies the secret to monetization, and ultimately long-term success.

There are lots of confusion on:

* Multiple companies for employer
* Multiple employments for candidate

Why Nokia is no longer in the game? It's all about Strategic Agility. Not being to understand where they are as an organization, not able to communicate properly with others so they can grow.

What's Jobline's North Star?

Jobline no doubt is an existing product. We can "still" improve it. What we think is missing from Jobline? What improvement to work on. To make it better. To be more well-crafted. Where we lose people?

> And so the other half of what we do is just making the products that we have better. Better meaning easier to use, meaning more well crafted, meaning introducing improvements constantly, week over week, and month over month, to the things that people are using like newsfeed or how they share photos and videos, or groups or all of the features that people know about Facebook. We're constantly making improvements to those. And a lot of how we figure out what improvements to make is by doing user research, is by responding to user feedback, is by doing a bunch of brainstorms with our teams, saying "What do you think is missing from this? What do you think we can do to make this better and better?". We have a much more structured way of figuring out what are those things that we should be making improvements on so that every single month we're doing something that's pushing this product forward. - [Design for impact](http://drt.fm/julie-zhuo/)

**Why focusing on UI can boost productivity!**

If you take a look at the FileMaker UI, it is very compressed and compact, like bloomberg-style. But it is what the recruiter is familiar with. And they won't want to trade that for a more clean with many whitespace kind of UI. Or UI that require them to page through from screen to screen even if the screen is easy to use and do a single thing which supposedly is a good thing. But to recruiter having everything in one screen is good.

**Jobline is a simple app. Don’t overcomplicate it.**

**What is your organization VALUE STREAM**

Enterprise system is a complex, adaptive system. It cannot be understood by reductionism. One one single person can understand the whole system. It will have emergence behaviours. You cannot stop that behaviours.

> Today my Jawbone is a fairly basic data collection device. It knows that I walked 8,000 steps and slept too little, but it doesn't drive me to action other than providing me with a visualization of the data. In the Age of Context this will change, as larger and larger data sets of sensor data, combined with other data combined with intelligent analytics allows data to become actionable.

---
> The Twitter vs. Instagram experience is really reinforcing what matters when designing a product. What kind of behavior can we encourage? What kind of moments can we create for people? What do people anticipate before they use something? How does it leave them feeling when they’re done? These are now some of the most important questions for me when working on a design. - [Look and Feel and Feel](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3868-look-and-feel-and-feel)

> 
> The reason for saying we need to do 'an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution' is this: When you want something really bad, you will put up with a lot of flaws. But if you do not yet know you want something, your tolerance will be much lower. That's why it is especially important for us to build a beautiful, elegant and considerate piece of software. Every bit of grace, refinement, and thoughtfulness on our part will pull people along. Every petty irritation will stop them and give the impression that it is not worth it.

> Genetic programming is the process of simulating nature’s evolution system by producing populations of candidate programs and filtering out the programs that don’t pass the tests. The candidates that do pass the tests survive and form the basis of the next generation.

> Genetic programming offers the possibility of continual, automated improvement on hot code and critical algorithms. There is real potential to point a genetic programming algorithm at a git repository and automatically push new generations of software to production when the population improves on prior deployed versions.

## Story-First

> A business cannot survive on first-time use and engagement alone. While we were proud of the product we built and the results it was getting, this was just one usage story: the first-time usage story. What about the rest? What might be the next inciting incident to kick off a new story? What would be the next beginning, middle, and end? Then what? What if someone did not return? Cliffhangers can happen during a flow that lasts a few minutes or over a period of days, months, or years. Over time, we developed stories big and small, one-offs and serials, improving the story for both customers and the business. Since we started building story-first, FitCounter has tripled in size and tripled its valuation. It is now a profitable business and recently closed yet another successful round of financing so that it can continue this growth.

## New feature tour

Help people learn and grow. Proactive notification. Prompt people to take action at the right time.

See Facebook's Action You Might Take (AYMT)

* [Headway - To announce new feature](https://headwayapp.co/)

## Terms

* Encounter, Prospect, Context
* JobRadar, JobKind
* 

## Articulating Design

* CEO Button
* Homepage Syndrome

Ask yourself these:

1. What problem does this solve?
2. How does this affect the user?
3. Why is it better than the alternatives? What set the solution apart so people can agree with you?

## Normalised list of skill

If enough people add the same skill, we can normalize it. See https://vimeo.com/110012665

If CA1 is in the same school as CA2, compare and recommend the skills both have and prompt each to add to it.

## Main things, secondary thing

To Bob, the main thing is to take leave. To Alice, main thing is to keep track of payslip.

> Paving the cowpaths philosophy - we don’t like to tell you what to do, we like to find out what you’re doing, and then get the obstacles out of your way.

## Talent

Editing profile is an important process for Jobline. It is how we are able to match CA with jobs. We must find ways to make CA regularly update their profile.

"CA Profiling - In-progress"

Show when a CA is currently being profiled. So it act as a awareness meter for other recruiters to gauge the level of engagement.

### Talent Networking

* [SAP Scouting](http://awards.ixda.org/entry/2014/sap-scouting/)

Social graph. 1 or more degree away from better referral.

Maintain good intel.

Do not "inactive" user, instead "dormant" them. They can come back later.

"How do you study inactive user?"

## Design for the moment

* [Moments as a currency](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/04/24/moments-as-a-currency-brian-wong-on-identifying-and-addressing-customers-needs-at-tnw-europe-conference/)

> One of the techniques that can be used to see customer's needs at specific moments (steps, stages) and at the same time to see the whole picture of their journey is Experience Mapping or Customer Journey Mapping.

## Microservices

Bounded Context - Identify discrete business capabilities (functions). Functions govern part of enterprise data model.

[The Scale Cube](http://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html)

* Client API
* Talent API - Candidate, BIO, Resume/CV
* ATS API - Applicant, Application, Pipeline
* Billing API
* Employment API

Candidate in ATS bounded context is called Applicant. Don't ever create a God object for a single Candidate and try to write Applicant's behaviors in it.

Be smart about your boundaries. Boundaries are explicit. Bounded Context.

> Some platforms may have users explicitly connecting with each other, as in social networks. Some may have users not connecting but exchanging items as in marketplaces. And some platforms may have an implicit community layer. E.g. If you use the Nest Thermostat or Mint.com, your usage is benchmarked against others. So you are benefiting from the community implicitly but you don’t explicitly connect with them.

---
> The final layer is the data layer. Every platform uses data in some way. But in some cases the data layer may play a more dominant role than in others. In most cases, data serves to provide relevance, matching the most relevant content/goods/services with the right users. In other cases, the value may exclusively lie in the data layer. The Nest Thermostat example, as we will revisit below, is what one would think of as a data-intensive platform, where the value is entirely in the data being aggregated with a minimal. - http://platformed.info/platform-stack/

---
> The Platform Stack is a tool for us to think through platforms and plan them. Irrespective of what you’re building, the stack helps to figure which layers you differentiate yourself in and how. It helps understand the key strengths of businesses that are already out there in the market. Without getting lost in the quagmire of features and functionalities, the stack helps us understand the key drivers of value and helps us benchmark ourselves on those parameters against competition and substitutes.

* Track activities all around (See Atlassian Stash)
* The dashboard of CL is not very helpful in their day to day tasks, especially when it comes to month's end where they need to approve timesheets, leaves, etc. The level of audit and tracking is lacking also, such as who approve what, and when.
* CL really is confuse with the arrangement of what tasks they should do "right now", and how to keep track of what they have done.
* There is no way to know when Timesheet is being approved. Right now, I am using PostMark to see when email was sent to client to ask them to approved to determine Timesheet's submission date time.
* Creating timesheet is not idiot-proof. People can create Jan timesheet when it was Dec now! We must at least alert CA that Jan is not the correct month!

* Some job categories are obsolete like "IT & Telecommunication"
* Let staff view their own job handling
* Scoreboards, leaderboards, let consultants see how they ranked among the entire community and adjust their strategy and velocity.
* SOA - some has partial payment and we can see the `amt_os` to know what is left for outstanding. I think only `nett_payable_w_gst` need to change to reflect the same as `amt_os` while `amt_payable_w_gst` remains.
* Display a "poo" besides those pipeline stages where it is long and smelly
* Scheduling interview - Missing CA at DB!
* Should we email CA when they
* [Invoice Me](http://invoiceto.me/)
* Have a web_db for Employer also so that we can track which employer has account already.
* Eliminate integration database or lessen its use
* Query visualiser - like "All active CLCT under CP_Main and CP_CC in all active SRID in the following CLID under Amy"
* Instead of requiring client to select their company if they have multiple companies, why not present all of it.
* Have data-structure to track verified NRIC, email, mobile phone (for SMS sending), etc.
* With each SMS being sent, we constantly see if the number is clean or not. Cross-associated SMS sent with the client/CA etc.
* Code Memo. Rules, etc. See MaxQDA. Code CA's resume? Like Medium website comment where you select/highlight chunk of text and mark it or comment on it.
* Separate cron jobs to a git **branch** and then deploy the cron jobs into another machine, different from the main operation machine.

* For Timesheet, let CA opt-in to work on Public Holiday, instead of having them opt-out when they press the "default" hours to pre-filled the working hours.
* Case study for extensions. See Docker Machine's provider concept or Vagrant provider concept. If Jobline need any customisation for our customer, we can use such provider concept. Like Manpower Staffing cannot login, etc.. instead of hardcoding emails into the Dashboard controller.
* FileMaker log has device tracking, for web do we even know which devices tag to user account to check if they can access the content. For example the case with Andrew accessing FileMaker using Janna Rose's password. Do our web have such capability to track?

> Deciding what data to expose to people isn't just about how much - it's about what it says too. One idea Patil and Belkin played around with was marketing jobs to people - like, "Hey, you should apply for this job because it matches your skills!" Soon, they realized this approach was fraught with peril.
> 
> "There was too high of a chance that we'd accidentally recommend a more senior person should apply for an internship, or that a confirmed California resident should move to Idaho for work. When stuff like that happens, people get pretty pissed off, and it can mess up your brand pretty fast," Patil says. "You have to think about what that particular feature will actually be like for a user when he or she sees it. This is where you need to be clever - and when it comes to data products, clever beats smart nine times out of ten."
> 
> The clever solution in this case was to approach job recommendations from a different angle. If "Bill" is the user they are trying to reach, then instead of sending recommended job openings directly to Bill, they decided to send them to his network with the short note: Recommend Bill for this job. It used the exact same algorithm, but with a little twist, it took care of the hard relevancy problems
> 
> "If Bill hears from one of his friends that they think he should take a job, he can still say, 'Yeah sure man, you're an asshole,' but that's rarer, and the site would never be blamed," Patil says. "Beyond that, we get to collect all the data that allows use to figure out what's going on with this feature and make it even better."

Business transaction data is well-understood and solve by SQL. Unstructured data like text, images and videos can't be solved by SQL.

Data analysis -> Break into group -> Targeted marketing (marketing as in the sense of value awareness)

Can you answer these questions:

* How many leaves requests you service for this month/year?
* How many timesheets Jobline process every months?
* Request flow (Twitter and Netflix)

Check out histogram so as not to skew data reading.

**Put like product together. Put similar job posting together to increase the likelihood of CA applying for that job. See Amazon recommended books.**

Exit Survey, longitudinal study, Attitudinal data

Treat recruiters as **marketers**, where they have to perform data-driven campaigns. Recruiters need to sell a product (Job Order) to potential customers (candidates) and a well-run campaign supported by data-driven system is the way to go.

## Pipelines

Pipeline Scrubbing - Is it useful. See Spotify scrubbing experiments. See interesting peaks and spots.

Pipeline lifecycle. Timesheet lifecycle, etc.

The average consultant needs about 30 new leads to keep their pipeline healthy. Half of those should be inbound leads, referrals, and leads that come in through network. The other half should be leads you contact cold.

**It's all about timing**. Being the first to email a lead to your client will hurt that CA's chance.

> When you email a lead you found via a job post you probably think being one of the first people to contact them is important. That’s not really true. Being one of the first actually means your email gets mixed in with a ton of junk. Sometimes waiting to email a lead will actually help you stand out from the crowd. Some Workshop customers wait weeks or months to email the leads I send them and get better results. - [Workshop](https://medium.com/@letsworkshop/7-lessons-learned-from-finding-hundreds-of-clients-on-job-boards-5982287243ae#.ton9v6tet)

With "end-to-end audits".

```
Sources -> Filters -> Sinks
(CA/JD) ->   ATS   -> Hired/Rejected
```

## Redis

For payslip, past timesheet, anything that involved past records, we tried to cache it at the Redis level for fast access or just to make FileMaker less load.

Even if we nuke the Redis, we can still populate it upon as people request the resources.

We can key the payslip quarter by quarter. So we pulled down 3 months worth of payslip and it's JSON representation to the Redis server and never has to bother asking FM again.

## Storage

Make use of Amazon S3 as much as possible. For simple invoice file caching, or resume caching, we can use S3, etc.

## SMS

Our current SMS reply is not scalable with `Reply 'JL @35845' followed by your message to 8100382`. We should use `@r1` or `@m1` to represent recruit1 and msd1 and then link the phone number to form a nice conversation flow.

Track how many SMS being sent per day, then we can make more decision on usage:

```
SmsMessage.where(created_at: Date.new(2014,11,21).beginning_of_day .. Date.new(2014,11,21).end_of_day).count
```

Support for Emoji needs utf8mb4. Or just use Postgres.

* If failed to send SMS, notify also to the consultant so they can act on it, rather than email only to IT for `DeliveryImpossible`.
* [Rails 4.1 and MySQL 5.5 support utf8mb4](http://tech.taskrabbit.com/blog/2014/04/24/active-record-mysql-and-emoji/)
* [Unicode support in MySQL is...](http://www.codeka.com.au/blog/2014/02/unicode-support-in-mysql-is--)

## Customer Development

Be it customer service.

Make our customer our evangelist.

Have you ever spend any time with customer?

This is FALSE: "Customer aren't using things the way we designed them"

Who "owns" the customer relationship? The Account Manager? Sales?

Have a concept of a "Account Holder" and their own CRM.

## Payroll

ZenPayroll's Platform team, where we build automated systems to detect fraud and make sure people get paid in full, on time.

* [MOM mandatory itemised payslip in 2016](http://www.aghrm.com/index.php?x=events&id=16)

## Accrual

INR accrual can only have all same `work_year`.
@mech - not sure what this meant, but must be something to do with Xero accrual import on that year where work_year is not the same.

## Leave

* Take leave screen should have some helpful tips, recovery, approval process info.
* Show whole year public holidays.

## Timesheet

Submit timesheet will have a lock to indicate it can't be amended.

When submit timesheet, we will send email of the summary to CA. Like total time, any strange timing like time-in during Public Holiday. Just a prompt to prevent them from submitting the wrong time-in.

Have option that allow CA to indicate that TS should follow the previous month values. Sort of like how IRAS file your income tax. It will be automatic if you do not have any new things to add/change.

Send an email that says "We noticed for the past 3 months your TS hours are the same, we can auto-submit for you if you are sure you never change your TS."

Remove NRIC on TS PDF.

**Timesheet and leaves and a reactive system**

What happen when timesheet was submitted for pending approval and CA take leaves? Approver should get alert/warning that there is pending leaves being add on to a populated timesheet day's hours. If the leave is approved on that day, the timesheet must null out all the hours and reflect the new total hours being logged. **Make it reactive!**

---

When email for timesheet approval, we can show the overall total-hour taken by each candidates.

If there is only 1 candidate to approve, we can show all the details in the email and one "Approve" button which will approve without requiring them to login, or login automatically.

* TS approver did not track reject timestamp.. no history.... Jason need to always get the created_at and approved_at. But there is no rejected_at.

We need to have better S3 upload failure recovery. Sometime it is caused by unicode in filename like a Chinese character.

```

## Change of Approver

* [See ZOHO approval process](https://www.zoho.com/people/help/approval-process.html)

If approver for a certain SRID or project has been made, all pending leaves, timesheet, etc need to be updated to the new approver. Any email for the pending items need to be resend so the "new" approver will know to act on it.

## Resignation

Eve can submit resignation repeatedly!! This may result in multiple `RCAID2131`, `RCAID2132`, etc. We need to prevent this!

This happen when Eve is on the phone guiding CA to submit resignation, but CA's network is too slow and he press the submit button multiple time.

* [POP vs IMAP](http://www.pop2imap.com/)

We send reminder to approve timesheets for client (approver) and list down the candidate names. If they are like Chris Goh who need to approve 47 candidates, and he only approve 20, our next email reminder will "encourage" him to close it in the last mile by introducing some cute animation? characters?
