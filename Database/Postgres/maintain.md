# Maintenance

If your database is within 100GB, it can still be served comfortably on a single instance.

## Sharding

> In order to determine the ideal sharding key you need to examine the query load and types of operations youâ€™re looking to perform. If you are storing aggregated data and all of your queries are per customer then a shard key such as customer_id or tenant_id can be a great choice. Even if you have minutely rollups and then need to report on a daily basis this can work well. This allows you to easily route queries to shards just for that customer. As a result of routing queries to a single shard this can allow you a higher concurrency.
