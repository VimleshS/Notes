# Elasticsearch

Dedicated masters is a MUST. 3 nodes at least. Keep your indices balanced, not balanced cluster can lead to instability. When in AWS, spread between availability zones.

* Full-text search + Analytics + Distributed = Elasticsearch
* Near real-time GET request
* Not just good at search engine. Also a powerful analytics engine.
* Document-oriented using JSON. Nested data searchable also.
* 96 API endpoints
* 672 parameters
* [Elasticsearch as a NoSQL database](https://www.found.no/foundation/elasticsearch-as-nosql/)
* [Elasticsearch in Production](https://www.found.no/foundation/elasticsearch-in-production/)
* [Document relations with Elasticsearch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXbsJsFfpV4)
* [Using ES to help running the large Hadron Collider of CERN](https://medium.com/@ghoranyi/needle-in-a-haystack-873c97a99983)
* [OpenDNS use of ES](https://engineering.opendns.com/2015/05/19/elasticsearch-you-know-for-logs-part-4/)

Has Nested and Parent/Child relationships.

* index (noun) - database
* type - table
* document - row

## With Rails

* [How we integrated ES and Rails at Pose](http://blog.andrewvc.com/elasticsearch-rails-stretcher-at-pose/)

## Backup and Restore

* [Introducing snapshot and restore](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/introducing-snapshot-restore/)
* [Snapshot restore API](http://chrissimpson.co.uk/elasticsearch-snapshot-restore-api.html)

## Scoring

* Term frequency - the more often a term appears in a field, the more relevant.
* Inverted document frequency - the more often a term appears in the inverted index, the less relevant.
* Field length norm - the longer the field, the less relevant each term in it is.

Fields are "boostable" to increase relevance.

## Elasticsearch Gem

`Elasticsearch::Model.client` represents all the models.

## Production

* [Pre-flight checklist](http://www.elasticsearch.org/webinars/elasticsearch-pre-flight-checklist/)
* Don't use development setting
* Use uni-cast. Disable multi-cast!
* Change `cluster.name`, `path.data`, `node.name`, `path.log`, `path.conf`
* To update/upgrade Elasticsearch/Java/Kernel, always stop shard reallocation first
* Pre-flight: Configuration, JVM Heap, Hardware, and Monitoring
* `gateway.recover_after_nodes: 5` to prevent shard swapping for full cluster restart. Once the cluster has been started, this has no effect.
* `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3` (n/2)+1 -  to prevent split-brain
* `ES_HEAP_SIZE` of 1GB is wrong. Set about half of your system RAM. Don't give more than 50% of your RAM. Your OS also need 50% of the RAM. Never use > 30GB because of JVM compressed object pointers.
* Concurrent Mark and Sweep collector has "Stop the Word" effect.
* Do not swap! Allocate memory upfront: `bootstrap.mlockall = true` and allow unlimited allocations: `limit -l unlimited`
* SSD: use "noop" or "deadline" scheduler
* RAID: performance, not High Availability
* `max_file_descriptors: 30000`
* http://localhost:9200/_nodes/jvm
* Make sure client is using persistent connection. Check it with `localhost:9200/_nodes/http/stats`
* Non-data node - Master-only node and Client-only node.
* Use snapshot and restore for backup. Do not use rsync anymore.

```
// A dynamic settings, you have to continuously update it as and
// when the node size changes.

curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{
	"persistent": { "discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes": 3 }}'
```

## Parent-Child Indexing

De-normalized during indexing!

* JOIN at query time - Parent/child
* JOIN at index time - Nested objects (array, inverted index)

## Query DSL

Query-string search like `_search?q=last_name:Smith` is not as powerful as Query DSL.

JSON over HTTP. Essentially a Abstract Syntax Tree for queries and filters. Can be overwhelming when you see a full page of query JSON. But if you think of it as a tree, you can deconstruct it. It has a easy grammar. Think of it as building blocks.

Query is heavy and Filter is light. Use Query for full-text search, relevance scoring and real data and use Filter for everything else.

* Core queries - match, multi_match, phrase, fuzzy, regexp, wildcard
* Compound queries - filtered, bool, function score
* Core filters - term, range, exists, geo_distance, geo_bbox, script
* Compound filters - bool, and/or/not

Below is an example of a *filtered query* that contains a query and a filter. Whew! We are looking for results that are 2014 and newer.

```
{
  "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
        	  "must": {},
        	  "must_not": {}        }              },
      "filter": {
        {"range": {"created_at": {"from": "2014-01-01"}}}      }    }  }}
```

> "I want to find hotels called Renaissance for under $200, within 100m of Central so I am close to RubyConf. The hotel needs to have disability access and ideally provide WIFI and have rooms above ground level."

Under $200 and within 100m of Central are *perceived requirements* and can be flexible. WIFI is a MUST!
Why perceived, because I will be willing to pay $210 or $201 also.
	
Use the right toolset; and know your data.

```
{
  "bool": {
    "must": {},
    "must_not": {},    "should": {}  }}
```
	
```
{
  "bool": {
    "must": {
      "multi_match": { "query": "Renaissance", "fields":["name^2", "company"]},
      "term": { "features": "disability_access" }
    },    "should": {
      "term": { "features": "wifi" },
      "range": { "floor_levels": { "gt": 1 } }      
    }  }}
``````
{
  "gauss": {
    "price": {
      "origin": 0,
      "offset": 100,
      "decay": 20          }  }}```

See [gist](https://gist.github.com/mech/f4002d7031b8541e857a) for full query.

## Range Query

```
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/products/_search' -d '{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "offer",
      "query": {
        "range": {
          "price": {
            "lte": 50
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```
