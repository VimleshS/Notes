# Layout

> A sculptor may sit down to sculpt something without a clear idea of the exact form it will take; sometimes we need to start pushing and pulling on the clay to see what comes out of it.

> Composition of our layout and typographic systems needs to take our medium's constraints into account.

History of layout in CSS is table, float, inline-block, display:table, flexbox, then grid.

**Important**: All percentage-based sizes must inherit from parent block elements, and if any of those ancestors fail to specify a size, they are assumed to be sized at 0 x 0 pixels. For that reason, we declare percentages for both `html` and `body`:

```
// The parent block element MUST specify their sizes
html, body { height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; }

* [Example to see for layout](http://cssdeck.com/labs/css-switchboard)

Rather than designing pages, which will inevitably break as our canvas shrinks and grows, we should design modules that can be reconfigured and remixed into various layouts. Create a system rather than treating the layout as a discrete unit. See [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

Steps to do layout:

1. Do semantic HTML outline first.
2. Mindful of margin, padding and their collapsing behavior.
3. em and percentage and their containing parent.
4. Any extra wrapper/grouping to use or not.
5. Always use normal document flow to layout and only use float when necessary.
6. Always have grid system. Think of it as your shelves. You put up your shelves then fill them with your stuff. By setting up our grids separately to our components you can move components around a lot more easily then if they had dimensions applied to them.
7. Find the content constraint and then use it to determine the grid.

Types of layout: Fixed, Fluid, Elastic, Hybrid, Responsive.

* [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* [Harry's advice on layout](https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines#layout)

Purpose of layouts:

1. **Sequential Order**. What user want to do first, and next. Business goals.
2. **Visual Hierarchy**. Guide the eye. Size, color, spacing, etc.
3. **Associative Connection**. What goes with what?

These are the options for layout:

1. Flexbox - Very one-dimensional, not really grid-like
2. `display: table` - Will have redundant markup and positioning oddities
3. `inline-block` grid - Will have white space issues
4. `float` grid - Need clearfix hacks
5. CSS Grid Layout - The holy grail?

## Media Queries

```
// Mobile first
article, aside { width: 100%; }
@media screen and (min-wdith: 480px) {
  article { float: left; width: 68%; }
  aside { float: right; width: 30%; }
}
@media screen and (min-wdith: 800px) {
  article { padding: 20px; }
}
```

### Resolution media queries

```
1 device pixel == 1dppx
4 device pixel (iPhone4) == 2dppx
9 device pixel (HTC One) == 3dppx

@media (screen and min-resolution: 2dppx) {
  body {
    background-size: 50% !important;
  }
}
```

## Flexible Layout

Remember margins and padding calculate their value as a percentage of the PARENT element! Especially for nested container.

* Percent: relative to the containing block.
* Em: relative to the containing block's font size.

If you put `em` at `margin`, `padding`, `width`, or `height`, the value will be multiply by the `font-size` of the element itself, and not the parent!

Use of `min-width` and `max-width` common.

## Grids

> While hierarchy lets you plan your typography at a micro level, a grid allows you to arrange the type and everything else it interacts with on the page at a macro level. It helps readers traverse content and exposes an informational system to them.
> 
> For example, if you use a grid and your headlines always appear in a certain spot or your images always appear at certain dimensions, readers can recognise that consistency. Those patterns are signposts that light the way for viewers to find what they're looking for in the content and to distinguish between elements.

Invisible grid that hold the structure together.

Nearly every grid system is based on rows and columns, set to 12 or 16 increments to create any layout. However, the web is changing! It's time for Flexbox to shine.

Grids exist in relation to the content. We never start with a grid. We start with an idea which is then translated into a form, a structure.

> "What drives me insane in modern web design is grids. What's important is a page that moves. Now, as news flows in, editors can very quickly reshuffle what we're doing on the page, because every module is moveable. Instead of rigid grids, the site is built from these building blocks so we can snap them together like Lego. The news becomes intent driven, rather than layout driven." - Josh Topolsky, editor of Bloomberg Digital

Don't be afraid to mix it up and implement a 3 or 5 column grid. No need to always use 12-column layout. Sometimes, simpler really is better.

Because the web is unlike print, you don't have pre-determine dimension. You need to work **content-out**: let the content define the grid.

* Content-Out
* Future-Friendly
* System Design
* Offline-First

Grids work on two levels: first perception, then experience. That is, a user feels the grid, then he uses it.

`viewport-height` to create full page web apps.

Separate it into layout-object and content-object.

`flex-wrap` not supported in Firefox, so be careful.

Steps for flexbox:

1. Create flex container using `display:flex`
2. Set its `flex-direction` to control orientation
3. Set its `flex-wrap` to control whether and in which direction to wrap (or `flex-flow` as shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`)

`box-sizing` only takes care of padding and border added on to width, not margin! But with flexbox, it is taken into account.

## Masonry

* [Salvattore - A jQuery Masonry alternative with CSS-driven configuration](http://salvattore.com/)

## Collapsing Margins

* [SitePoint's collapsing margins](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/collapsingmargins)

These are some cases where margins do not collapsed:

* Floated elements
* Absolutely positioned elements
* `inline-block` elements
* Elements with `overflow` set to anything other than `visible`
* Cleared elements (they do not collapse their top margins with their parent block's bottom margin)
* The root element

Margins only collapse vertically. Horizontal margins will just combined.

A simple `border` or `padding` on the parent block is enough to prevent collapsing. You can use `1px` padding and `9px` margin for a effect of `10px` margin.

In IE7 and below, no margin will collapse if the element `hasLayout`.

But why collapsing margins? It does make life easier in the case of multiple nested elements, where the behavior is often desirable. Take for example this `<p>` style:

```
p { margin: 10px 0; }
```

The top and bottom margins will combine give `20px`, but because of collapsing, the paragraph will look ok with just `10px`.

## Float

Because block elements typically span 100% of their parent container's width, floating an element **to the right** knocks it down to the next line. To fix it, just reverse the source order.

So what's the limitations of float-based layout?

* Difficulty with containment
* Unwanted wrapping, a.k.a. "float drop"
* Visual location tied to HTML order
* No built-in equal height columns
* No `float:center`

If you don't support IE6/7, then don't bother clearing floats in these browsers. `zoom: 1` is only for IE6, so don't bother.

Floating elements mean they are remove from *normal document flow*, so their containing parent thinks they are not there and so collapses itself. The problem you get will be disappearing background and overlapping content.

```
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<style>
  .clearfix { zoom: 1; }
</style>
<![endif]-->
```

Using SASS placeholder to `extend` clearfix.

```
%clearfix {
  &:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
  }
}
```

## Positioning

* [Why use absolute positioning for web UI](http://wiki.sproutcore.com/w/page/12412895/FAQ-AbsolutePositioning)
* [Full-height app layouts](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/10/05/full-height-app-layouts-a-css-trick-to-make-it-easier/)

`static` and `relative` are considered to be in normal document flow.

`relative` - can be offset and following elements react as if the element were not offset. They think it is still there. So why would you want to use `relative`?:

1. For slight tweaking, to move something up a little bit here and there.
2. To provide positioning value for container elements, more for `absolute` positioning. Serve as the offset point.

`absolute` - Removed from normal flow. Absolute also allow clipping like `clip: rect(50px, 200px, 150px, 50px)`

## Overflow

CSS quirks - various state of `overflow` triggering block formatting context.

`overflow` only ever work with a defined `width` and `height`.

* [Default for overflow?](http://bocoup.com/weblog/new-overflow-default/)

For many layout tasks collapsing margins really aren't what we want.

## List

List are block by default. Use it as inline.

    li { display: inline; }

## inline-block

* [For IE6/IE7](http://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2009/02/20/cross-browser-inline-block/)
* Supported since IE8
* `vertical-align` is a feature, not a bug
* `text-align` gets you left, right, or center
* The whitespace thing is a bug. Use zero-size fonts on the container to fix.

This is what Compass will give you:

```
.incline-block {
  display: -moz-inline-stack;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
  *vertical-align: auto;
  zoom: 1;
  *display: inline;
}
```
